    <h1>Buttons</h1>
    <p>The button element by default will submit the form if inside a form.</p>
    <p>
      If the type is changed to button, it will not submit it, just click like a
      regular button with no default behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the button is outside a form, it will also just click. Does that
      click?
    </p>
    <p>If not, here are some examples.</p>
    <hr />
    <form action="./fake">
      <label for="username"
        >Please choose a username:
        <input type="username" placeholder="username" id="username"
      /></label>
      <label for="password"
        >Please choose a password:
        <input type="password" placeholder="password" id="password"
      /></label>
      <button type="">Register</button>
    </form>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This past button did not have itÂ´s type set to anything, but since the
      default is to submit form, it did. This would depend on the location you
      choose on the form element itself, (the action attribute).
    </p>
    <hr />
    <form action="./fake">
      <label for="username"
        >Please choose a username:
        <input type="username" placeholder="username" id="username"
      /></label>
      <label for="password"
        >Please choose a password:
        <input type="password" placeholder="password" id="password"
      /></label>
      <button type="button">Register</button>
    </form>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The only difference in this second form is that the button type is set to
      button, so even though it is inside the form, it does not get submitted.
    </p>
    <button>Press me!</button>
    <p>And this one just clicks since it is outside any forms.</p>
