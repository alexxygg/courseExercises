    <h1>HTML Validations</h1>
    <p>
      They help us to make sure the input from user matches a certain pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many built in validations in HTML, for example the email input
      type would make sure that there is a @ sign in the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also it is worth talking about the required attribute, if entered in the
      input field, it will not let us submit a form until properly filled out,
      and can be applied to any input you would logically want to use it on.
    </p>
    <p>Here you can submit the form without even entering text.</p>
    <form action="fddfdfd">
      <label for="username">Enter a username:</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="..." />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p>
      But here we used required, so it will have to be filled before submitting.
      It will show an alert saying to fill the field first.
    </p>
    <form action="fddfdfd">
      <label for="username">Enter a username:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="username"
        id="username"
        placeholder="..."
        required
      />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p>
      Of course we can add things to check for specific patterns, like making
      sure it is between x and x characters(min and max), that it included a
      special character,etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we show the input type email with required on, a message tells us to
      make sure we enter the @ sign if we have not.
    </p>
    <form action="fddfdfd">
      <label for="email">Enter an email:</label>
      <input
        type="email"
        name="email"
        id="email"
        placeholder="user@example.com"
        required
      />
      <button>Continue</button>
    </form>
  </body>
