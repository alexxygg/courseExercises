    <h1>The Cascade</h1>
    <p>
      This term refers to the order in which things are styled in CSS. The order
      in which they are declared is important.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have changed the color of the h1 header two times, you can see in the
      code that the blue color is after the red color in order up to down. So
      that is the color that will be applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we had 2 CSS stylesheets, and the h1 color was also styled in the
      second sheet, that would be the value kept and saved. It would change to
      red first, then blue, and if say we had applied gold on the second CSS
      page, it would stay gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that second page was listed before this one on the head part of our
      HTML, it would first be gold, the red, and finally blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the code we used: h1 { color: red; } h1 { color: gold; } h1 {
      color: blue; }
    </p>
