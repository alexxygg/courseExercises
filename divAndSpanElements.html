    <h1>Div and Span Elements</h1>
    <p>
      The div element helps us put multiple content types in the same block.
    </p>
    <p>
      The span element lets us choose a certain span of text, which can later be
      styled with CSS.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="./frankAndAsap.jpeg" alt="" />
      <p>This paragraph is in the same div as the image.</p>
      <a href="hkfskdhjkds">And so is this fake link.</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now look at the same content without a div element below this paragraph.
    </p>
    <img src="./frankAndAsap.jpeg" alt="" />
    <p>This paragraph is in the same div as the image.</p>
    <a href="hkfskdhjkds">And so is this fake link.</a>
    <p>
      Not many changes, actually none, but wait until you use CSS along with
      divs!
    </p>

    <p>The same thing happens with the span element.</p>
    <p>
      This text has the word <span>red</span> surrounded by a span element, but
      since there is no CSS, nothing really happens.
