    <h1>Inputs</h1>
    <p>
      A form is a document section containing interactive controls for
      submitting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action attribute comes with it, this is to enter the location where
      the info will be sent to.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>The input element is a self-closing one.</p>
    <p>Below are four input types, text, color, password and number.</p>
    <p>
      The placeholder attribute is used to have a grayed out text shown to the
      user, which is immediately removed upon the user entering any information.
      It is inside the input element.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>Text is used for usernames, or any other text.</p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your username, or any text!" />
    <hr />
    <p>Color is to choose any color. No placeholder for color unfortunately.</p>
    <input type="color" />
    <hr />
    <p>
      Password is pretty starightforward, you can not see any text entered for
      security purposes.
    </p>
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password" />
    <hr />
    <p>
      Number is for any number, all keys that are not numbers will not work with
      this input type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also it has an up and a down arrow to decrease or increase the number
      entered.
    </p>
    <input type="number" placeholder="Enter a number" />
  </body>
