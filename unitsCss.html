    <h1>Units</h1>
    <p>
      Percentages help us make an element´s width and height to a percentage of
      the parent´s width and height.
    </p>
    <p>Here we have a div with a width and height of 150px.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p>
      Below we have a section inside a div, the parent div is styled in navy
      blue, while the child section is styled in gold. We have given it a 50%
      width and a 50% height.
    </p>
    <div><section></section></div>
    <p>
      It is half as tall and half as wide, so we could fit 4 of these in the
      same space the parent div occupies.
    </p>
    <p>Here we set the child´s height to 25% and the width to 75%.</p>
