    <h1>Width and Height</h1>
    <p>
      Everything is composed of boxes, each has the content box, where all the
      text or content goes. Then goes the padding, which sorrounds the content
      box. And lastly we have the border, which does the same but for the
      padding.
    </p>

    <h2>Width and Height</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a paragraph. All paragraphs in this document have a light colored
      background. We have changed its width to 200 px, see how the background
      color shows us how it has changed from the other regular paragraphs.
    </p>
    <p>The blue color shows how much space the box takes.</p>
    <p>
      The height has also been changed to 200px. It looks a little bigger than
      needed because the content normally occupies less than the dimensions we
      set.

    <p>
      The header has a different background color, it stretches to the end of
      the page because we have not altered any of its dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The h2 on the other hand, was changed to a width of 300px. It looks much
      smaller than the h1.
