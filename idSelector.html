    <h1>id Selector</h1>
    <p>
      The id selector helps us style a specific element from our HTML, which we
      must have identified as an id beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that there can only be one id with the same name
      per HTML page.
    </p>
    <p>Here we have 5 buttons, the third one has an id called third.</p>
    <p>That code has been left as a comment below this paragraph.</p>
    <!--<button id="third">I´m the 3rd button!</button>-->
    <p>
      We used this code to style that specific button´s background-color: #third
      { background-color: sienna; }
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that since it is an id, it needs a hashtag before the name of the
      id when styling on our CSS page.
    </p>
    <button>I´m the 1st button!</button>
    <button>I´m the 2nd button!</button>
    <button id="third">I´m the 3rd button!</button>
    <button>I´m the 4th button!</button>
    <button>I´m the 5th button!</button>
  </body>
