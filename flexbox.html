    <h1>LetÂ´s play with FLEXBOX</h1>
    <p>
      Below is a section wih 5 divs inside it, they would normally be
      block-level, meaning they would take up their height all the way to the
      end of the screen(right side), but since display was set to flex, they are
      behaving like columns.
    </p>
    <p>The main axis goes left to right.</p>
    <p>The cross axis goes up to down.</p>

    <h2>This is how they look without any flexbox property.</h2>
    <section id="noflexbox">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>And here it is set to display:flex.</h2>
    <p>
      The default for flex is flex-diretion: row. Adding it would not make any
      changes.
    </p>
    <section id="flexbox">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>This is display:flex with flex-direction: row-reverse.</h2>
    <p>Our divs are now starting from right to left, but still in a row.</p>
    <section id="rowreverse">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>This is flex-direction: column.</h2>
    <p>
      The divs are going from top to bottom, it looks just like originally when
      display:flex was turned off, but the difference is that if the height of
      our container section was less, so as that the divs could not fit in it,
      theye would adjust to whatever that size was. The very first example would
      have the divs flying off the container, conserving their sizes.
    </p>
    <section id="column">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>
      And this is flex-direction: column-reverse. It acts like row-reverse, but
      fitting in the container again.
    </h2>
    <section id="columnreverse">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>justify-content: flex-start</h2>
    <p>
      This is the default value for justify content, so it would be the same to
      have it or not when we are dealing with a row.
    </p>
    <section id="rowflexstart">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>justify-content: flex-end</h2>
    <p>
      This one pushes the divs to the right, since they were sent to the end of
      our container.
    </p>
    <section id="rowflexend">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>justify-content: center</h2>
    <p>
      This one takes the left over space and divides it in two, half to the left
      and half to the right, with the divs right next to each other at the
      center.
    </p>
    <section id="rowcenter">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>justify-content: space-between</h2>
    <p>
      This one takes all the space left over and divides it to be split equally
      between each div, with the first and last div touching the edges of the
      container.(splits space between elements, not between elements including
      container.)
    </p>
    <section id="rowspacebetween">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>justify-content: space-around</h2>
    <p>
      This one splits the space equally for each side of a div, which is why it
      has half the space on the outer limits getting close to the container
      edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be seen as if each side had an invisible margin, and since some
      divs are next to each other, it is double on that side compared to one
      which may share one of its sides with the container edge.
    </p>
    <section id="rowspacearound">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h2>justify-content: space-evenly</h2>
    <p>
      This one spaces all the space in exactly the same amounts between each div
      and between the divs that are next to the container limits.
    </p>
    <section id="rowspaceevenly">
      <div>A</div>
      <div>B</div>
      <div>C</div>
      <div>D</div>
      <div>E</div>
