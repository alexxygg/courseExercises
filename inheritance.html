    <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
      This means that when we are not specific when styling, the elements inside
      whatever we styled will inherit those values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have a form with 3 buttons inside it, each with its own label.
    </p>
    <form action="dffdfdf">
      <label for="a">A</label>
      <button>A</button>
      <label for="b">A</label>
      <button>B</button>
      <label for="c">A</label>
      <button>C</button>
    </form>
    <p>
      Not the form, labels or buttons were styled, only the body. Since all of
      these elements are inside the body, they have inherited the color
      darkgreen from it.
    </p>
    <p>This was all the code: body { color: darkgreen; }</p>
    <div>
      <p>
        This paragraph is inside a div, which we styled with this code: div p {
        color: darkblue; }
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The rest of the content is still dark green, but not that one!</p>
    <p>
      There is a property we can set for any element, class or id called
      inherit, it inherits the styles of the nearest parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not every element will inherit every property, and not all properties are
      inheritable.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
