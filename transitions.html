    <h1>Transitions</h1>
    <p>Transitions are really fun!</p>
    <p>They help us animate our websites and look cool while theyÂ´re at it.</p>
    <p>
      We set the div:hover to do a few things. We have changed the
      background-color to cyan when hovering on the elements. Also, the boxes
      will cahnge to circles when hovered since we modified the border-radius to
      50%. And we added a left-margin of 500px to have it slide to the right
      when in the content element area, which is wrpping all the divs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition: has been set to 3 seconds on the div element, since they
      are all div boxes anyway.
    </p>
    <section>
      <div class="one">ease-in</div>
      <p>
        The red one has a transition timing function called ease-in. This one is
        slower at the beginning.
      </p>
      <div class="two">ease-out</div>
      <p>The orange one was set to ease-out. This one is slower at the end.</p>
      <div class="three">steps(5)</div>
      <p>
        The yellow one has been set to steps(5). It moves down the 200px in 3
        seconds like the rest, but in 5 steps.
      </p>
      <div class="four">linear</div>
      <p>
        The green one has a linear function, it goes at the same spped the whole
        way.
      </p>
      <div class="five">ease-in-out</div>
      <p>
        This one has been set to eas-in-out, so it is fast in the middle, and
        slow at the beginning and end.
      </p>
