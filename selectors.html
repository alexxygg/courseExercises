    <h1>Selectors</h1>

    <p>Selectors help us style our HTML.</p>

    <h2>Universal selector *</h2>
    <p>
      The universal selector selects every single element on the page and styles
      it according to what we enter.
    </p>
    <p>We used it for the text color, which includes that of the buttons.</p>
    <p>The code looks like this: * { color: blueviolet; }</p>
    <button>Hello</button>
    <h2>The element selector</h2>
    <p>This one uses the element we enter only, such as h1,h2,button,etc.</p>
    <p>The background color of the h2 elements was styled this way.</p>
    <p>This was the code used: h2 { background-color: aquamarine; }</p>
    <h2>Combining element selectors</h2>
    <p>
      We can also list multiple element selectors with a comma in between them
      to have the styles applied to all of them specifically.
    </p>
    <p>We styled the h1 and paragraphs background colors this way.</p>
    <p>This was the code used: h1, p { background-color: gold; }</p>
