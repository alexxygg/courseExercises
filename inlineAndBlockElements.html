    <h1>Inline and Block Elements</h1>
    <p>We have seen inline elements before, and also inline elements.</p>
    <h3>This h3 header is a block-level element by default.</h3>
    <div><p>So is this paragraph.</p></div>
    <p>These next elements are inline-level elements.</p>
    <button>We are inline-leveled.</button
    ><button>We are inline-leveled.</button
    ><button>We are inline-leveled.</button>
    <p>
      But we can change this by using the display option. Here we have two h2
      headers.
    </p>
    <h2>I have been changed to be inline.</h2>
    <h2>I have been changed to be inline.</h2>
    <p>And also three buttons changed to block-level.</p>
    <button class="blocked">I have been changed to block-level.</button>
    <button class="blocked">I have been changed to block-level.</button>
    <button class="blocked">I have been changed to block-level.</button>
    <p>
      These buttons occupy the whole row, Even though they could technically all
      fit in one line.
    </p>

    <h4>Inline</h4>
    <p>
      The inline elements have
      <span class="bad"> width and height ignored.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="neutral"> Margin and padding </span>push elements away to the
      <span class="good"> left and right</span>,
      <span class="bad"> but up and down is ignored.</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Block</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="neutral"> Width, height, margin and padding</span>
      <span class="good"> are respected.</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Inline-Block</h4>
    <p>
      This one behaves like an inline element, except that
      <span class="good"> width, height, margin and padding </span
      ><span class="good"> are respected!.</span>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Here are 3 divs, all 50px on all sides and with a 5px black border each.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are taking the whole space from left to right because they are
      block-level elements.
    </p>
    <div class="normaldivs">Hi</div>
    <div class="normaldivs">Hello</div>
    <div class="normaldivs">:)</div>
    <p>Here we have the same divs, but we set the display to inline-block.</p>
    <div class="inlineblockdivs">Hi</div>
    <div class="inlineblockdivs">Hello</div>
    <div class="inlineblockdivs">:)</div>
  </body>
  <p>Also setting display to none will hide an element from our page!</p>
