    <h1>Transform</h1>
    <p>
      Transform helps us make changes to the content we decide to transform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to know that if we have various elements in a parent
      element, and we transform that parent, all the children will also be
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, any elements inside a div, paragraph or the element we transform
      will be affected, be a button or anything else.
    </p>

    <section>
      <div>transform: rotate(10deg);</div>
      <p>This transform rotates our div by 10 degrees.</p>
      <hr />
      <div>transform: scale(1.2);</div>
      <p>
        This transform makes our div 1.2 times as big as originally, it can be
        0.5 to make it half of the original size.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <div>transform: translateX(100px);</div>
      <p>
        This transform moves our div in the x axis (horizontal axis) by 100 px.
        We can use negative values here to move it to the left.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <div>transform: translate(-50px, 30px);</div>
      <p>
        This transform moves our div to the left by 50px, then moves it down the
        y axis by 30px.
      </p>
      <p>We had to give this one a margin-bottom to see this text.</p>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <section>
      <div>transform: skew(20deg);</div>
      <p>
        This transform acts as if we were pulling it from a corner, it was set
        to 20 degrees.
      </p>
      <div>transform: skew(10deg, 5deg);</div>
      <p>
        This transform does the same as the previous, but it was pulled from the
        x and y axis by 10 and 50 degrees respectively.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Combining transform properties.</h2>
      <div>transform: rotate(10deg) scale(0.7);</div>
      <p>
        This transform rotates our div by 10 degrees, and is also scaled down to
        0.7, leaving our box 70% as big as it was originally.
      </p>
      <div>transform: translateX(-200px) rotate(180deg);</div>
      <p>
        This transform moves our div 200px to the left, which is why it is a
        negative value first, and then rotates our box by 180 degrees, leaving
        it upside down.
      </p>
      <p>The text is------transform: translateX(-200px) rotate(180deg);</p>
