    <h1>Padding</h1>
    <p>
      It is in between the content and the border, like a pacjkage from Amazon,
      when packaged properly.
    </p>
    <p>The h1 has a padding of 30px.</p>
    <p>
      The top, left and bottom look evenly spaced out from the text, not on the
      right because of the amount of content, but this can be fixed by centering
      the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The width of the h1 was changed to 200 px to see these changes more
      clearly. The background-color is red, also for visibility.
    </p>
    <p>We can add padding juat to one side, two, three or all sides.</p>
    <p>
      Here are examples of the shorthands, each title was styled with its
      corresponding shorthand. And they all have a width odÂ¿f 300px.
    </p>
    <h3 class="allsides">All sides</h3>
    <p>To pad all sides, only one value is needed, like this: padding: 10px</p>
    <h3 class="leftright">Left and Right</h3>
    <p>
      We first enter a value for top and bottom. The second value is for the
      left and right. Like this: padding: 20px 30px;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or we can leave 0px on the top and bottom, so it looks like this button:
    </p>
    <button>padding: 0px 20px;</button>
    <h3 class="threevalues">Top, Left and Right, and Bottom</h3>
    <p>
      This syntax takes 3 values, the first for the top padding, the second for
      the left and right paddings, and the the third for the bottom padding.
    </p>
    <p>The header has this: padding: 20px 50px 60px;</p>
    <h3 class="allfour">All 4 sides one by one</h3>
    <p>These work like the clock, top, right, bottom and left.</p>
    <p>We used this: padding: 15px 30px 45px 60px;</p>
    <p>
      But here is a button to make it easier visually since the header text does
      not make a good job of showing the contect box limits.
    </p>
    <button class="onebyone">One by one</button>
  </body>
