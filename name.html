    <h1>Name attribute</h1>
    <p>
      The name attribute is applied to the input element, it can have any name
      like a single letter or a word that has something to do with the input. It
      will show up on the search bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attribute is used when submitting forms. The text entered in each
      field will show up on the search bar when the reqquest is being processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the first form from the last examples. Submit the form, then look
      at the search bar and see what you find!
    </p>
    <p>
      The name chosen for username and password were awesome and entry
      respectively.

    <form action="./fake">
      <label for="username"
        >Please choose a username:
        <input
          type="username"
          placeholder="username"
          id="username"
          name="awesome"
      /></label>
      <label for="password"
        >Please choose a password:
        <input
          type="password"
          placeholder="password"
          id="password"
          name="entry"
      /></label>
      <button type="">Register</button>
    </form>

    <p>This is what came up after entering alexandalex and HardPassword101</p>
    <p>
      file:///home/alejandro/courseExcercises/courseExercises/fake?awesome=alexandalex&entry=HardPassword101
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the exact route it made to try to find the content, only problem
      here was that /fake is not a real location, which is why submitting the
      form fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been easier to use username and passwords as the names
      though.
